📊 Association Rule Mining – Market Basket Analysis

An end-to-end Data Science project that identifies customer purchasing patterns using Association Rule Mining (Apriori Algorithm) and deploys the solution as a Flask web application.

🔍 Project Overview

Retail businesses often struggle to understand which products are frequently purchased together.
This project analyzes transactional data to generate association rules that help improve:

Cross-selling strategies

Product bundling

Marketing decisions

🎯 Objectives

Discover frequent itemsets from transaction data

Generate association rules using Apriori

Evaluate rules using support, confidence, and lift

Deploy the solution as a user-friendly web app
